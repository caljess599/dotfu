How to use this repo

The 'af' function is used to source categories of functional aliases.

This function needs to know the location of the dotfu repo.

af(){
   repo=/$USER/dotfu
   if [ "$1" = "-v" ]; then
      dirs="${@:2}"
      for i in $dirs; do
         echo sourcing files in ${i} ...
         for j in $repo/$i/*; do
            echo sourcing $j
            source $j
         done
      done   
   else    #non-verbose   
      dirs=$*
      for i in $dirs; do
         for j in $repo/$i/*; do
            source $j
         done
      done
   fi
}

This function should be added to the $USER's .bashrc (or .profile.personal) file.

Upon login, you use the af function to source the commands you may need.

To 'automate' loading of functions, you can include in your .bashrc (or equivalent):

1) The afrec function, that echoes your prefered choices.

afrec(){
	echo af -v math rsc screen
} 

This is the safe option; upon login, use   
		eval $(afrec)
to load up those specified preferences

2) Call the function directly 

af match rsc screen

If untested functions are included, you may have trouble...
