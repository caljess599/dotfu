How to use this repo

The 'af' function is used to source categories of functional aliases.

This function needs to know the location of the dotfu repo.

On personal boxes, this should be correct:

af(){
	repo=/users/$USER/dotfu
	dirs=$*
	for i in $dirs; do
		echo sourcing files in ${i} ...
		for j in $repo/$i/*; do
			echo sourcing $j
			source $j
		done
	done
}

For boxes where we work as root, this should be correct:

af(){
        repo=/$USER/dotfu
        dirs=$*
        for i in $dirs; do
                echo sourcing files in ${i} ...
                for j in $repo/$i/*; do
                        echo sourcing $j
                        source $j
                done
        done
}

The relevant copy of this function should be added to the $USER's .bashrc (or .profile.personal) file.

Upon login, you use the af function to source the commands you may need.

You can also add a call of the af function itself to the .bashrc (or .profile.personal) file if you want to make sure that certain categories are always available upon login.
